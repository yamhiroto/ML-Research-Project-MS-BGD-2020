# ML-Research-Project-MS-BGD-2020
Research project with BearingPoint and Geoxilia during our Post-Master's Degree (2020)


## Subject : Machine Learning for Geomodelling 

- - - -
## Objective
Find alternatives method for Geomodelling, by applying Data Science approaches and Machine Learning algorithms. Application in lithology/facies identification (Scope might be extended to oil volumes predictions depending on our progress, to be confirmed with the companies)


**data**: Well logs records from oil fields located in the North Sea: JACKY / CROMARTY / ALWYN / BEATRICE
